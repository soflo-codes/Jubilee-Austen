                    <div class="half-width">
                        <p>My journey into tech came as a bit of a surprise. It was the summer after completing my Art History Degree
                            at the University of British Columbia Okanagan. I found myself not sure of what to do next, as much as I loved
                            learning about the history of art, I didnt quite have a skill I wanted to put to use. It wasnt until a friend who 
                            is a Software Developer told me to check out Web Development. A month later I was enrolled in Skillcrushs Break into
                            Tech course and I immediately fell in love.</p>
                        </div>
                    <div class="half-width">
                        <p>It wasnt until I coded up my very first website that I felt more accomplished than I have in years. Learning a completely
                            new language and skill empowered me beyond words. I have been able to apply my organizational skills to create clean and elegant code. 
                            My problem solving skills are essential when learning new skills and mitigating any issues that arise. I have been able to 
                            utilize my learning skills to stay focused and efficient when learning different languages. 
                            I currently live in the beautiful mountains of Whistler, BC. When I'm not coding I'm outdoors skiing, biking or playing with my dogs.

                        <p>My focus is writing clean, well-formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand to make sure that the content is easy to read, easy to collaborate, 
                                trouble-shoot and accessible.</p>

                        <h3>Well-Organized CSS</h3>
                        <p>I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I make it a habit to 
                                    stay up to date on current best practices.</p>
